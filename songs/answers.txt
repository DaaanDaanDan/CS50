If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

    I would characterize as a dancing and energetic aura, but not too cheerful and happy maybe, taking the average results of the three variables as parameter.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

    In my opinion this should average some other variables, like tempo, duration and mainly key, becouse those describe a lot about the song too, and they are not taking them as parameter to define the aura.
